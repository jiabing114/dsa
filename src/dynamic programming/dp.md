## dynamic programming
Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimiazation over plain recursion. The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems. This simple optimization reduces time complexities from exponential to polynomial.

1. 0-1 knapsack
2. longest common subsequence
3. matrix chain multiplication
4. subset sum problem
5. coin changing minimum number of coins
6. minimum edit distance
7. longest increasing subsequence
